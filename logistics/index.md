### Conference Fee

There is no conference fee.  GeoNode Summit 2016 is completely free.  However, we are looking for sponsors for secondary items, such as coffee, after hours events, etc.

### Locations

GeoNode Summit 2016 will be held in two locations in Rome, Italy: WFP and FAO.  The agenda is still under development, but the locations for each day will be updated as needed on the website.

First, the World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters is half-way from the city center to Fiumicino airport.  You can easily take the train from Roma Trastevere or Roma Ostiense train station to "Muratella" Train Station.  Trains leave every 15 minutes throughout the day and take from 9 to 15 minutes.

Second, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquarters is located near the city center and right next to the Circo Massimo metro station.  Circo Massimo is "Circus Maximus" in italian.

You'll find the locations in the map below.

### Accomodations

A list of hotels or other accomodations will be shared as soon as ready.
