### Conference Fee

There is no conference fee.  GeoNode Summit 2016 is completely free.  However, we are looking for sponsors for secondary items, such as coffee, after hours events, etc.

### Accomodations

We have a block of **25 rooms** at Starhotels Metropole near the city center of Rome for **€ 135** per night.  The hotel is within walking distance from Roma Termini, the main train station.  The address is:

```
Starhotels Metropole
Via Principe Amedeo 3
00185 Roma
```

Please use the following link to book.  For our block, we have a rate of **€ 135 per night**.  Please use the provided link rather than hotels.com, booking.com, etc.  For the first days of the Summit, we'll meet in the lobby before walking to the train station.

If you would like to stay elsewhere, AirBnb is a good option.  However, finding an affordable hotel closer to the city center and with a simpler commute will be difficult.

**By Flying**

If flying into Rome, The easiest way to get to the hotel is to take the **Leonardo Express** train from Fiumicino Airport (FCO) to **ROMA TERMINI** station.  The train takes approximately **32 minutes**.  The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the train station.  You can buy your train tickets at the station or online.

**By Train**

If taking the train into Rome, you can take **Trenitalia** or **Italo** to **ROMA TERMINI** station.  The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the train station.  If your train does not go to **ROMA TERMINI**, then you can transfer at **ROMA OSTIENSE** and then take a connecting train to **ROMA TERMINI**.  You could also transfer to the metro at **ROMA OSTIENSE** to **PIRAMIDE** metro, which is a few meters away.

### Conference Locations

GeoNode Summit 2016 is planned to be held in two locations in Rome, Italy: WFP and FAO.  The agenda is still under development.  We will update this page as new information is avialable and the agenda is confirmed.

**WFP**

The World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters is half-way from the city center to Fiumicino airport (FCO).  The address is:

```
World Food Programme
Via Cesare Giulio Viola, 68
00148 Roma
```

The most convenient and cost-effective way to reach WFP is via train; however, **Taxi** or **Uber Black** are both options.  **UberX** is not available in Rome.  In the morning, trains run every **15 minutes**.  Take the train to **MURATELLA** station.  If you are catching the train at **ROMA TRASTEVERE** station, the train should arrive on Platform 5 ("Binario 5" in Italian).  If you are catching the train at **ROMA OSTIENSE**, the train should arrive at platform 12.  Once you get off the train at **MURATELLA**, then exit toward the business park.  Walk to the right along the street parallel to the train tracks.  You should see a pathway to WFP (with a sign) that will take you to WFP.


**FAO**

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquarters is located very close to the city center and right next to the **Circo Massimo** metro station and a tram station.  Circo Massimo is "Circus Maximus" in Italian.  It is accessible from the main streets.  You can easily take the metro in the morning to **Circo Massimo**, but it may be busy.  You can also catch a tram around the Colosseum (Colosseo in Italian).

You'll find the locations in the map below.

### Entrance, Security, etc.

Normal security procedures will be followed at the World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Headquarters.  If you do not RSVP by **November 21, 2016**, we cannot guarantee entrance into the conference sites.  We will contact RSVP'd attendees and will provide instructions on how they should send a scanned copy of their passport to gain entrance.  When on site at WFP and FAO, your visitor pass must be visible at all times.

### Other Notes

**Google Maps:** You can download Google Maps offline.  Google directions for public transportation work most of the time.

**UrbanRail.net:** A great site for a map of the metro system.  However, it is missing the tram locations.

**Train Timetable Italy:** A very useful Android App for realtime train locations and for purchasing tickets.  Be advised, data is sometimes delayed, but it's very useful to know when a train is cancelled, delayed, etc.
