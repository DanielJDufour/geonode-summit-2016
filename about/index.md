### What is GeoNode?

GeoNode is a web-based Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) that enables sharing and collaborating on geospatial data.  The platform is built on a completely opensource stack, including the widely used [PostgreSQL/PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) and [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/).  Additionally, GeoNode is integrating the latest advances in opensource GIS software, including [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org/), [Tegola](http://tegola.io/), and many more.

### Open Source Origins

GeoNode was created in 2009.

### What is a GeoNode Summit?

Every few years, as resources allows, the GeoNode community gets together to discuss the future of the platform.  The summit includes program management staff, developers, and users.  All are welcome to attend and provide input.

### Past Summits

The GeoNode community has held 3 previous summits and many code sprints.
