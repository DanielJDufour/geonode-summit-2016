To meet the needs of a rapidly changing world, ([Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) (GFDRR) Innovation Lab supports the use of science, technology, and open data in promoting new ideas and the development of original tools to empower decision-makers in vulnerable countries to strengthen their resilience. Recent innovations in the field have enabled better access to disaster and climate risk information and a greater capacity to create, manage, and use this information.  Innovation Lab activities are designed and implemented in partnership with government institutions and key international and local partners, ensuring that all activities add value in planning, operational, and recovery activities.

In 2011, ([GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) launched the Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) to apply the concepts of the global open data movement to the challenges of reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. The OpenDRI team, in partnership with international and national agencies, has developed a suite of complementary tools to improve risk information through better access to data:

 * [GeoNode](geonode.org), a free and open source catalog of risk data and visualizations
 * Community Mapping, a community engagement approach that gathers information about the built environment through crowdsourcing (e.g., OpenStreetMap)
 * [InaSAFE](inasafe.org/en/), a open source tool that provides realistic disaster scenarios and their potential impacts

([GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/)) is supporting ([GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) Innovation Lab to meet these needs through:
* Core Development and support on GeoNode.
* Deployments of GeoNode.
* Provisioning of GeoNode trainings to developing countries.

([GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/)) has been supported the ([GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) group at World Bank with the tasks above as well as with specific GeoNode development in various emerging countries since late 2014.

In this presentation we will cover the GeoNode developments we have performed as well as those which are planned: we will make use of and refer to technical designs and architectural improvements adopted in GeoNode, as well as to the related GeoNode Improvement Proposals (GNIPs) which provide an instrument to gather community feedback and build awareness.

Developments that have been performed and/or are planned on GeoNode outside the support activities to the ([GFDRR](https://www.gfdrr.org/)) World Babnk group will also be covered.
